# Custom 106-Landmark CNN (Heatmap Regression)

This project implements a custom-designed CNN architecture for **real-time 106 facial landmark detection**, inspired by Hourglass Networks but optimized for speed and accuracy.

## Features
- Custom CNN Backbone (Depthwise Separable + Residual Blocks)
- Hourglass-inspired Decoder
- Heatmap Regression for 106 landmark points
- WFLW Dataset + 98→106 Landmark Conversion Pipeline
- Modular training system (PyTorch)
- Full preprocessing + dataset loaders + visualization tools
